    <h1> Make America Drip Again </h1>
    <p> I been dealing with fashion for about 3 years now. I always been neat and clean all around. As i got older I just started going to the mall more and started to just realize how hard I can really make an outfit even on a regular chill day. I started broading my horizons by wearing different colors instead of wearing the same dark colors. </p>

    <h2> Drip Off</h2>
    <p> My inspiration for fashion comes from is GUNNA "rap artist, rap god, drip god, the creator of DRIP". Gunna outfits is really threw out the window. Like I be wanting to know how he came up wit some of the ideas wit his fits. I think he gotta fashion designer just like most of the rappers thats known for there fashion. such ass young thug, gunna, Future, and Fabulous. I just feel like fashion is meant for me I know how to dress in suits and everything i'll get yo nephew together for any specail events if you want me too. As I get older i can plan to be a fashion designer just like to see what i can really do for other people too</p>
